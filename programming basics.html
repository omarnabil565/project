    <h3>
      The way to get acquainted with the basics of programming starts with the
      programming languages ​​that enable us to communicate with the computer by
      giving it directions and instructions that it can understand and
      implement. Programming languages, like human languages, have strict rules
      that must be followed and adhered to. It is estimated that there are
      between 500 and 2,000 active general-purpose programming languages ​​by
      some statistics, which is quite a number, but the majority of programmers
      in the world only use a few dozen of them. The computer does not
      understand programming languages ​​directly, it only understands one
      language, which is the binary language, which consists of a sequence of
      values ​​1 and 0 (hence the name), so programming languages ​​are usually
      translated into binary through a program called the compiler (compiler)
      before the computer executes it.

    <h2>Programming Basics</h2>
    <h3>
      Programming basics start with code - or code as some call it - which is a
      set of instructions written using a particular programming language. These
      codes are instructions that the computer executes sequentially. These
      instructions may be reading the content of a file, drawing a shape, or
      doing a calculation. However, the basic programming concepts are almost
      common in most languages, which will make it easier for you to learn
      programming in any language and to master such programming concepts and
      basics as: Constants: They are fixed values ​​that are defined initially,
      and do not change later at any stage of the program execution, such as
      mathematical constants, for example. Variables: inverse constants; They
      are values ​​that can be changed in memory whenever there is a need for
      that within the program's working mechanism. Conditional Sentences: It is
      the requirement that a specific condition be fulfilled in order for the
      required to be executed as an If-Then rule that requires the occurrence of
      After (If) to be achieved after Then. Functions: A set of commands, like a
      small program, that performs only one task. Loops: It is software whose
      goal is to execute specific parts of the code several times, specifying
      when it starts and ends, and the number of iterations

    <h2>The importance of learning programming</h2>
    <img src="img/افضل_لغات_البرمجة_للتعلم.jpg" alt="erorr" />
    <h3>
      Although there are many myths about programming as a result of its wide
      popularity, no one can argue with its paramount importance in our lives
      today, and among the reasons why you should learn programming : It is in
      high demand in the labor market: Programming is one of the skills in
      demand in the labor market, which brings a decent income to programmers.
      In the United States, for example, programmers average more than $70,000
      per year, which is a lot compared to other industries. Freedom of work: It
      gives you greater freedom to work, you can work from anywhere you want,
      from your home, from the office or anywhere in the world, all you need is
      only a computer. Critical importance: Some areas of programming are very
      important in advanced fields, such as artificial intelligence,
      cryptography, digital currencies and other promising sectors. Time factor:
      Learning the basics of programming to reach its professionalism does not
      require you a lot of time compared to other professions, for example, to
      become an engineer, you will need five years of study, in return, you will
      need to learn the basics of programming only a few months, and it will
      only take you to delve into programming and professionalism for a year One
      or two years at the most. Self-learning: You can start your journey by
      learning the basics of programming and even mastering it on your own, as
      there are thousands of free online books, lessons and educational videos.
      You do not need a scientific degree in order to learn programming , as
      many professional programmers did not go to university, and did not obtain
      any scientific degrees, yet they were able to make their way in the world
      of programming. Areas of use of programming languages 1. Website
      development and application building It is one of the most important areas
      of programming use, and website development is divided into two parts:
      Front-end development: This is the part related to designing the look of
      the site displayed by the browser, and usually requires learning the
      programming languages ​​HTML, CSS and javascript. Backend development:
      which is concerned with the server that contains the site files, and which
      makes the site available over the Internet to anyone and everywhere. This
      type of development requires learning languages ​​such as PHP, ASP, node
      or other programming language

    <h2>2. Windows Application Development</h2>
    <h3>
      Windows is the most popular operating system in the world, as 90% of
      computers run on this system. For this, we find a lot of programming
      languages ​​that make developing programs to work on this system easy, and
      the most famous of them are C, C++, R, python and many others.
    </h3>
    <h2>3. Game development</h2>
    <h3>
      Have you ever played a game and then wished you'd made a game like it?
      This has become possible today with the great development in programming
      languages ​​that made game development possible for individuals after they
      were the preserve of large studios, most of the famous programming
      languages ​​have become available libraries and tools that greatly
      facilitate the process of developing games. For example, Python provides
      the library pygame to make it easier for programmers to develop games,
      while C provides the library raylib among many alternatives. Also, in
      recent years, programs specialized in developing games have appeared.
      These programs are called game engines, and they are equipped with
      everything you need to develop any game you can imagine, and among the
      most famous of these engines are Unity3D, Unreal and many others.
    </h3>
    <h2>4. Mobile Application Development</h2>
    <h3>
      Programming mobile applications is different from building websites,
      because it requires learning additional techniques, especially with the
      presence of two different platforms, which are the Android and iOS
      platforms. Both of them need their own programming languages, Android
      needs to learn Java or Kotlin, while iOS needs to learn the iOS SDK.
      Fortunately, new technologies have recently emerged that can facilitate
      Android application programming , and iOS application programming . These
      technologies depend on the web languages, which are the programming
      languages ​​used to build websites (HTML, CSS, and javascript), which
      means that you will not need to learn new technologies, all you have to
      learn is web technologies, and you can use them to build applications as
      well. Helping this we find Cordova and Ionic.

    <h2>Learn basic programming languages</h2>
    <h3>
      There are so many programming languages ​​that it is impossible to learn
      all of them. Therefore, you must first understand the basics of common
      programming in most languages, and then focus on learning a programming
      language or a number of them according to the purpose for which you will
      use it, in this paragraph we will review the most prominent of those
      languages.
    </h3>
    <h2>HTML programming language</h2>
    <h3>
      HTML is used to create web pages and applications, and stands for
      Hypertext Markup Language. HTML pages are made up of tags and elements,
      which are the building blocks of web pages rendered by the browser. HTML
      elements consist of several parts, which are: Start tag : Contains the
      name of the element such as:
      <p>
        . End tag : Contains the name of the element preceded by a slash, such
        as:
      </p>
      Content : It is found between the beginning and the end tags. Features :
      and incorporated into the starting tag, such as:
      <p class="light"></p>
