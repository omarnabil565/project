      Top 10 programming languages ​​to learn to be an expert in Machine
      Learning
    </h1>
    <h3>
      In recent years, we have heard a lot about a new term, "machine learning"
      or "machine learning", which falls under artificial intelligence
      techniques, but when was this term first mentioned? In 1959, Arthur Samuel
      mentioned the word "machine learning" to investigate the development of
      algorithms that could be used to predict data by "conquering" completely
      static programming instructions to settle on predictions and data-driven
      choices. Today, machine learning is used in many areas of computing where
      the use of endless programming and design algorithms is not as practical
      as detecting a data breach that cannot be detected by traditional methods.
      Over the past two years, there has been an increasing demand for machine
      learning experts who are proficient in programming languages ​​that can be
      used in machine learning. Microsoft-owned coding repository, GitHub, has
      published a set of well-known programming languages ​​used for machine
      learning. While Python continues to occupy the number one position in this
      field, there are more languages ​​that can be learned to enter the field
      of machine learning.
    </h3>
    <h2 style="color: brown">Python</h2>
    <h3>
      Python is known to be comprehensive and can be used very well for various
      purposes. In the field of machine learning, this programming language
      contains libraries such as numpy and scipy, which enable your PC to learn
      linear algebra and kernel methods for machine learning. While dealing with
      machine learning algorithms, this language is widely used as it has a
      simple syntax. It is the best programming language for hobbyists.
    </h3>

    <h2 style="color: brown">R Programming</h2>
    <h3>
      This programming language was produced in the Bell Lab as an advanced form
      of the S language. In order to give adaptability in rendering statistical
      models, R was combined with lexical checking. Some of the GNU packages in
      R make it an amazing machine learning language. One can use R language to
      create valuable algorithms and a simple statistical visualization of those
      algorithms by using R studio. The importance of R language has been
      recognized by the industry of late even though it has been the trend of
      science professionals for a long time.

    <h2 style="color: brown">JavaScript</h2>
    <h3>
      Nowadays most web developers, new or former, use JavaScript. For a long
      time, this language was a limitation in web development, but at this
      point, with Tensorflow.js, an open source library for Google's machine
      learning system, it is now possible to use the language. in machine
      learning.
    </h3>
    <img src="img/javascript.png" alt="erorr" />
    <h2 style="color: brown">C</h2>
    <h3>
      This language is used for machine learning algorithms due to its high code
      execution speed. The practical use of C++ can help in using this language
      to build machine learning algorithms. This is among the languages
      ​​supported by the open source machine learning library from Google,
      Tensorflow, C language.
    </h3>
    <img src="img/C-Programming-Language-Wallpaper.jpg" alt="erorr" />
    <h2 style="color: brown">C#</h2>
    <h3>
      Data science is closely related to machine learning. And if you're from a
      .NET and C# foundation, you might want to use C# for machine learning.
    </h3>
    <img src="img/C.jpg" alt="erorr" />
    <h2 style="color: brown">Java</h2>
    <h3>
      Java is the most widely used programming language around the world, so it
      is one of the best options in the field of machine learning. In this
      language, along with Scala, the Grin framework is a comprehensive
      complement to machine learning, NLP, linear algebra, and a visualization
      framework. H20 is an open source machine learning platform that is fast
      and integrated for smarter applications such as deep learning, scaling
      enhancement, generalized linear modeling, and elastic network.

    <h2 style="color: brown">Shell</h2>
    <h3>
      Shell and Python are very simple, but not as powerful. However, due to its
      simplicity, it is among the best options as amateurs find it easy to use
      this language.
    </h3>

    <h2 style="color: brown">julia</h2>
    <h3>
      Julia combines the speed of C++ and Java with functionality from various
      well-known languages ​​such as Python, R, Matlab, SAS, and Stata.
    </h3>
    <img src="img/jcl-logo-300x166.png" alt="erorr" />
    <h2 style="color: brown">Scala</h2>
    <h3>
      Scala is very popular in the “big data” field, and its speed is many times
      faster than Python, as it uses the Java Virtual Machine at runtime.
    </h3>
    <img src="img/Scala_logo-300x123.png" alt="erorr" />
    <h2 style="color: brown">TypeScript</h2>
    <h3>
      TypeScript is known as a specific programming language that can
      drastically improve the development experience by giving assembly level
      type tests. Microsoft's machine learning platform, Windows Machine
      Learning, provides trained machine learning models for developers to use
      in Windows applications built using C#, C++, and JavaScript.
