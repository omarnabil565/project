    <h1>history of programming languages</h1>
    <h2>Early start</h2>
    <h3>
      At first, the early programming languages ​​that preceded the modern
      computer were simple symbols. For a period of nine months between 1842 and
      1843 , Ada Lovelace translated the notes of the Italian mathematician
      Luigi Menapin on the Analytical Engine , and it was the last machine
      proposed by Charles Babbage . She added this item to a set of observations
      that detailed a method for calculating Bernoulli's numbers with the
      analytical engine . These observations have been recognized by some
      historians as the world's first computer program. But the extent of Ada
      Lovelace's original contributions compared to her husband's is still a
      matter of debate among the translators. Hermann Hollerith realized that he
      could encode information on punched cards when he noticed that the marking
      of the train conductors appeared on the carry- on card depending on the
      location of the holes on the card. Then in 1890 Hollerith encoded census
      data on punch cards. It was the first Rmazat (blades / BB) computer
      specialized its applications. In the early decades of the twentieth
      century, numerical calculations were based on decimal numbers. It was
      finally realized that logic could be represented with numbers, not just
      words. For example, Alonzo Church was able to express the coefficient for
      lamda as a formula. The Turing machine was the epitome of a click learning
      machine, for example, as used by telephone companies. Turing machines were
      established to store programs as data in the von Neumann architecture of
      computers with a machine representation across a finite number. In
      contrast to the delta operator, Turing code does not serve high-level
      languages ​​well—its primary use is by rigorous analysis of computational
      complexity theory . Like many "beginnings" in history, the first
      contemporary programming language is difficult to identify. From the
      start, hardware limitations defined the language. The punch card allowed
      for 80 columns, but it was difficult to use some columns to arrange a
      number on each card. Fortran included some English-style keywords, such as
      "if", "go to" (go to) and "CONTINUE". The drum's use of memory means that
      computer programs also need to be fed as the drum rotates. That's why the
      programs were more dependent on the hardware. For some people, the first
      modern programming language relies on its human readability and the amount
      of energy needed before making the so-called "programming language"
      available. It's engine variation (engine spacing) for Jaquard to Omz and
      Carles simple and limited Babbage languages too in order to describe the
      acts that must be carried out by those machines. One can regard the hole
      punch on a piano tomar (darj) as a domain-specific language , even if it
      is not designed for human consumption.

    <h2>Early programming languages</h2>
    <h3>
      The first electric computers appeared in the modern era in the 1940s (the
      1940s). The limited speed and memory capacity required writing
      time-consuming programs in assembly language. It required a lot of
      intellectual effort, and it led to many errors. The first programming
      languages ​​were designed to deliver instructions to a computer in the
      1950s. The oldest high-level programming language was designed for
      computers between 1943 and 1945, called Plan Cal Kill , and was developed
      by Konrad Zuse for the Z3 . However, it was not implemented until 1998 and
      2000. The short code programming language was introduced in 1949 by John
      McClei , and was one of the first high-level languages ​​developed for the
      electronic computer . contrast to machine language , statements in a
      mathematical short code language are represented in an understandable
      form. However, the program must be translated into machine language every
      time it is run, which makes the process slower than running the program's
      equivalent machine code. The Manchester Mark 1 is running a program
      written in Autocode in 1952. Autocode was developed at the University of
      Manchester in the early 1950s. It is a programming language that uses an
      assembler to automatically convert a language into machine language . The
      first assembler code was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the
      University of Manchester and is considered the first high-level assembler
      programming language . A second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by
      Ralph Anthony "Tony" Brooker in 1954 and was called Mark 1 Autocode.
      Autocode was also developed by Tony Brooker for Ferrante Mercury in the
      1950s in collaboration with the University of Manchester . A version for
      the Electronic Delayed Storage Calculator 2 (EDSAC) was devised by David
      Fielding Hartley of the Mathematics Laboratory at the University of
      Cambridge in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a direct development
      from Mercury because of its special representations and auto-conditions.
      The source was advanced at the time. A parallel but separate contemporary
      development was Atlas AutocodeDeveloped for the University of Manchester's
      Atlas 1 machine . In 1954, he invented John Backus , the language Fortran
      in IBM ; It was the first widely used high-level language to have
      functional implementation, in contrast to paper design. still a popular
      language for high-performance computing used for programs as a standard
      and arrangement for the world's fastest supercomputers . Another early
      programming language devised by Grace Hopper in the United States, called
      Flowmatic . It was developed for UNIVAC 1 at Remington Rand between 1955
      and 1959. Huber found that business data-processing clients were not
      comfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955 she and her team
      wrote and implemented an assignment for an English programming language
      and implemented a model. The Flowmatic complex became publicly available
      early in 1958 and was completed in 1959. The Flowmatic was a major
      influence on COBOL's design , at which time its use was limited to the
      management of USAF equipment and supplies. . Other languages ​​still used
      today include Lisp (1958), which was invented by John McCarthy and Cobol
      (1959), which was established by the Short Range Committee. Another
      milestone in the late 1950s was the publication of a "New Language for
      Algorithms" by the European American Committee of Computer Scientists; It
      was called ALGOL 60 (taken from ALGO rithmic L anguage). This report
      reinforces many of the current ideas and highlights three key language
      innovations: nested brick architecture: Strings of code and declarations
      can be grouped into (programming) bricks without having to be transformed
      into separate, clearly named procedures; Lexical space : It has its own
      variables, procedures, and functions, and is hidden from codes outside it,
      and this is what is called data hiding . A new innovation close to this,
      was about how to describe language: The Bacchus Nour (Exact mathematical
      numeration) formula is used to describe the grammar of languages. Almost
      all of the later programming languages ​​have used many Bacchus norms to
      describe contextual freedom rules in their syntax. The language Algol 60
      influence on the subsequent languages irrevocable designs, has become some
      of them wide popularity. The Burrows Large System is designed to be a
      sub-extension of Algol. Algol's key ideas continued to produce Algol 58 :
      Grammar and semantics became more compatible, and an unknown protein
      emerged as the recursive writing system with higher-order functions. Not
      only was the 'freedom of context' part defined but also all grammatical
      and semantics of language were formally defined by the terms of the Van
      Wegengaard rules ; They are formalities designed specifically for this
      purpose. The little use of Algol 68 features (eg, convergent and parallel
      blocks), its complex system of semantic abbreviations, and forced
      automatic type identification made it unpopular with users and gained a
      reputation as a "difficult" language. Niklaus Wirth stepped out of the
      committee to create a simpler language, Pascal . Fortran

    <h2>Establishing basic patterns</h2>
    <h3>
      The period between the late 1960s and the late 1970s brought a major boom
      for programming languages. Most of the major language patterns in use
      today were invented in this period: pub (computing environment) ,
      developed in 1964 at Argonne National Laboratory by Stanley Cohen , is an
      object-oriented programming language more similar to Matlab , an
      interactive data language, and thelater Mathematica Numericpackage. It has
      awell-defined Fortran grammar. The beginningphysical computing Banonh
      effective internally at the Argonne National Laboratory ,research has been
      amended (name Modelici (for use in English : Modeleasy )) for the Board of
      Governors of the Federal Reserve ( English : Federal Reserve , Board Of
      Governors) in the early seventies and after that it became commercially
      available; Still bar ( in English : for speakeasy ) and Modelici currently
      used. Simula , invented in the late 1960s by Nygaard and Dahl as an
      extension of Algol 60 , was the first programming language designed to
      support object-oriented programming . C , a language for systems
      programming, was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell
      Laboratories between 1969 and 1973. SmallTalk , which appeared in the
      mid-1970s, provided an integrated architecture for an object-oriented
      programming language. Prolog , designed in 1972 by Alan Colmerauer, Philip
      Russell, and Robert Kowalski , was the first logical programming language.
      M. L. , girl type many forms system ( English : Polymorphic Type System )
      (invented by Robin Milner in 1973) on Lisp , leading programming languages
      functional fixed type . Each of these languages ​​gives a whole family of
      sub-languages, and most modern languages ​​have at least one ancestor.
      Also, in the sixties and seventies there was widespread debate about the
      merits of ' structured programming ', which basically means programming
      without the use of ' goto '. Some programmers believe that even in
      languages ​​that provide "goto", its use is considered bad programming
      style except in rare cases. This argument is strongly related to language
      design: some languages ​​do not include "goto" at all, thus forcing the
      programmer to do structured programming . To provide the speed of the
      assembly , and provided some languages « complexes track one » (one-pass
      compiler), which expects to be defined Routines of the first, as in Pascal
      , where the main function or routine leading is the last section of the
      program. Some of the languages ​​developed during this period:

    <h2>The 1980s: hardening, units, performance</h2>
    <h3>
      The eighties of the twentieth century were the years of relative rigidity
      in the American languages rather than the invention of new styles, and all
      these movements expanded on ideas created in the past decade. It merged C
      ++ between programming and object - oriented programming systems. Aida has
      been adopted by the United States government as a systems programming
      language for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, huge
      amounts of money have been spent on the invention of so-called fifth
      generation programming languages that combine programming logic
      structures. The functional language community has moved to make Lisp and
      ML standard languages. In this decade, research on the Miranda language
      began ; It is a functional programming language with lazy evaluation . An
      important new trend in language design is the focus on programming for
      large-scale systems using "libraries" or large-scale organizational units
      of code. Both developed Modula , Ada , M. L. prestigious libraries systems
      in the eighties of the twentieth century. These systems often stuck to
      generalized programming structures . Despite this, the majority of the new
      patterns of the imperative programming languages ​​did not appear, and
      many researchers have expanded on the ideas of the first languages ​​and
      adapted them to the new approach. For example, the Argus and Emerald
      system languages ​​are appropriate for object-oriented programming with
      distributed systems . The 1980s brought advances in applications of
      programming languages. The computer architecture instruction set assumed
      that computer architecture should be designed for assemblers and not for
      human assembly programmers. Thanks to the processor speed improvements
      that have enabled rapidly accelerating assembly techniques, the
      instruction set of computer architecture has sparked a growing interest in
      assembly technology for high-level languages. Language technologies
      continued to advance in the 1990s.

    <h2>The 1990s: the era of the World Wide Web</h2>
    <h3>
      The World Wide Web , also called the Internet or the Network ; Taken from
      the phrase: Inter national Net work. Haskell loa Ripoll D programming
      language The rapid growth of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s was the
      next major event for programming languages. Opening a radically new
      platform for computer systems, the World Wide Web created an opportunity
      for the adoption of new languages. In particular, the JavaScript
      programming language increased in popularity due to its early integration
      with the Netscape Explorer . Many scripting languages ​​have achieved
      widespread use in developing custom applications for network servers such
      as PHP . The 1990s did not see any major development in the American
      languages , but there were many crosses and the maturation of old ideas.
      During this period, functional languages began to spread . A new profound
      philosophy has emerged: “Programmer Productivity”. Fbzgt many languages
      «rapid application development» ( English : rapid application development;
      Acronym: RAD), which usually come with an integrated development
      environment and garbage collector and descend from the oldest languages.
      All of these languages ​​were object-oriented . It includes Object Pascal,
      Visual Basic, and Java . Java in particular has received a lot of
      attention. Scripting languages wereMore innovative than Rapid Application
      Development languages. These did not descend directly from other languages
      ​​and offered new syntax and other, more liberating features. Some
      consider these scripting languages ​​to be more productive than "rapid
      application development" languages, but this is often due to options that
      make small programs simpler but large programs may be harder to write and
      develop. Nevertheless, textual languages ​​have become the most prominent
      and used to communicate with the network. Some of the languages
      ​​developed during this period: 1990 - Haskell 1991 - Python 1991 - Visual
      Basic 1993 - Ruby 1993 - Lua 1993 - AR 1994 – Common Lisp object system
