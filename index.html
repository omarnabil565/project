    <h1>The number of programming languages</h1>
    <h3>
      A programming language is the set of instructions through which humans
      interact with computers. Nowadays, there are many programming languages
      ​​that have become more general and multipurpose, but these languages
      ​​have their own specializations, and each language has its own advantages
      and disadvantages. Usually, programming languages ​​can be categorized
      into a few types. However, these languages ​​support multiple programming
      style, a number of programming languages ​​are implemented every year, but
      few languages ​​have become so popular that a professional programmer
      might use in his career. Programming languages ​​are used to control the
      performance of a computer or device, a computer programmer has many
      options to choose the language, but there are many differences between
      programming languages, the total number of computer programming languages
      ​​out there is about 9000, although there are 50 of the most popular
      programming languages used today.
    </h3>
    <h2>What is the programming language?</h2>
    <h3>
      A programming language is a notation designed to communicate instructions
      to a machine or a computer. Programming languages ​​are mainly used to
      control the performance of a machine or to express algorithms. At present,
      thousands of programming languages ​​have been implemented. In the field
      of computer, many languages ​​must be mentioned in the imperative form,
      while using Other programming languages ​​declarative form, the program
      can be divided into two forms such as syntax and semantics, some languages
      ​​are specified by the SO standard such as C language.
    </h3>
    <h2>How many programming languages?</h2>
    <h3>
      A programming language is a programming language used by computer
      programmers to develop programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions
      for computers to execute. Although many languages ​​share similarities,
      each has its own syntax, once a programmer has learned the language's
      grammar, syntax, and syntax, he writes the source code in a text editor or
      IDE, after that, the programmer often translates the code into Machine
      language that a computer can understand. Scripting languages, which do not
      require an interpreter, use an interpreter to execute the text. There are
      an incredible number of computer programming languages ​​used by
      programmers, software developers, web developers, and other computer
      science professionals, there are about 700 programming languages,
      including esoteric markup languages, other sources that only list the
      notable still amount to an impressive 245 languages . Another list called
      HPL, which claims to include every programming language that has ever
      existed, puts the total number of programming languages ​​at 8945, some
      even estimating the total as high as 25,000. Some of the types of
      programming languages ​​you have are Java, JavaScript, and Coffeescript;
      Python and Ruby, C, C++, C#, and Objective-C; Cobol, ALGOL 58, ALGOL 60,
      ALGOL 68, ALGOL W, BASIC; Fortran, assembly languages ​​and machine
      language, there is an amazing array of other different programming
      languages. [1]

    <h2>Tube – 250</h2>

    <h3>
      The TIOBE index is one of the best lists of popular programming languages
      and it monitors 250 popular programming languages, TIOBE tracks a
      programming language if it passes 3 tests: it must have its own Wikipedia
      page, it must be Turing complete, and a Google search for it must yield
      over 5000 search result.
    </h3>
    <h2>Wikipedia - 700</h2>
    <h3>
      Wikipedia has a list intended to include all the notable programming
      languages ​​out there, which currently lists more than 700 programming
      languages, Wikipedia's list excludes certain types of languages ​​such as
      markup languages.

    <h2>Foldok - 1000</h2>
    <h3>
      FOLDOC, the online computing dictionary from the 1990s, lists over 1,000
      programming languages, although that includes aliases.
    </h3>
    <h2>Language List - 2500</h2>
    <h3>
      The list of languages ​​started in 1991, tracks 2,500 computer languages,
      the list of languages ​​includes popular languages ​​as well as many
      published languages, if a language is published in a magazine, it may be
      on the list, regardless of its implementation history or popularity. [3]

    <h2>The difference between different programming languages</h2>
    <h2>C++</h2>
    <h3>
      C++ has an object-oriented architecture which is used in large projects.
      Programmers can collaborate on one program in different parts or even one
      individual work in each part of the program. The object-oriented
      architecture also allows code to be reused multiple times. This language
      is an efficient language, but Many programmers disagree.
    </h3>
    <h2>C language</h2>
    <h3>
      C is a basic programming language and it is a very popular language,
      especially used in game programming, because the C language includes the
      extra packing of C++, every programmer uses this language because it makes
      programs faster, however, the value of this language gives the possibility
      to reuse C++ for a slight performance boost with the C language.
    </h3>
    <h2>Pascal language</h2>
    <h3>
      Pascal language Pascal language is often the language of teaching and uses
      a small number of industries this language to write programs, this
      language tend to use keywords instead of symbols and parentheses in the
      language of C, so it is very easy for novices to understand this language
      more than a programming language such as C and C++. Borland is a compiler
      software company, that uses the industrial strength Delphi programming
      language, Delphi is a Pascal oriented language, and currently only used by
      Borland compilers.
    </h3>
    <h2>Fortran language</h2>
    <h3>
      Fortran language is a crunching language and still used by scientists,
      this language allows different sizes of variables up to the memory limit
      in the device, this language is suitable for engineers who have to
      calculate values ​​with high accuracy, the program in Fortran language is
      inflexible and sometimes difficult to read.
    </h3>
    <h2>Java language</h2>
    <h3>
      Java is a cross-platform language and is especially useful in networking,
      of course, this language is mostly used on the web with Java applets,
      however, this language is used to design cross-platform programs, since it
      is similar to C++ in structure And syntax, for C++ programmers, Java is
      very easy to learn and provides some of the advantages that
      object-oriented programming provides, such as reusability and it can be
      difficult to write efficient code in Java, but nowadays Java has increased
      speed and version 1.5 offers some The good features of creating a program
      are easy.
    </h3>
    <h2>Perl</h2>
    <h3>
      Perl is a file management language for UNIX, but it is more commonly
      Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming, a term referring to software
      that web servers can implement to allow additional capabilities for web
      pages, Pearl is a method for searching text and used for useful server
      functions and other databases , and it is very easy to get to know the
      basics if you have any experience in any language, as CGi, web hosting
      services choose Perl over C++, because, web hosts can review Perl text
      files, since they are text files, when compiling C + +.
    </h3>
    <h2>PHP</h2>
    <h3>
      PHP is used to design web pages and sometimes it is also used as a
      scripting language, this language is designed for fast website
      development, as a result it includes features that make it easy to create
      HTTP headers and link to databases, as a scripting language, it includes a
      set of components that allow the programmer to access To speed easily,
      however, it has more advanced features geared.
    </h3>
    <h2>LISP . language</h2>
    <h3>
      Lisp language is mostly used in computer science research and stores all
      data in lists like arrays, syntax in this language is very simple and
      structures are easy for developers to implement.
    </h3>
    <h2>chart language</h2>
    <h3>
      Scheme Language is an alternative programming language to Lisp. It has
      simpler syntax and features. Any project within the Scheme language will
      result in a re-implementation of most of the Lisp language. However, this
      is a very popular introductory language in the MIT Department of Computer
      Science. This language solves problems easily instead of worrying about
      the syntax of the programming language. [2]
